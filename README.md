# Credit Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This group project involves analyzing a real-world dataset to develop predictive models for line of credit approval/denial using various machine learning algorithms. The project aims to apply machine learning concepts to address a practical problem and present findings in a final report.

## Tasks
1. **Dataset Selection and Problem Definition:**
   - Select a dataset from a reputable source.
   - Define a problem statement and hypothesis for the analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform data cleaning and handle missing values.
   - Conduct descriptive statistics and visualizations.
   - Identify trends and detect anomalies.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Apply transformations, scaling, and feature selection.
   - Handle categorical variables appropriately.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Implement various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines).
   - Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, AUC, MSE, and RMSE.
   - Compare models and select the best one(s).

6. **Final Report:**
   - Document the analysis, methodology, results, and conclusions in a comprehensive report.
   - Ensure the report is well-structured, clear, and concise with appropriate figures, tables, and citations.
